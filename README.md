## The case of Henry of Brussels

Henry of Brussels (or in Dutch: Hendrik van Brussel) was a poet, active in the larger Brussels area between ca. 1250-ca. 1330. Of one particular text, we can be rather sure that it was written by Henry, since he incorporated his name in its final verse lines: _Van de Coninc Saladijn_ (English: _Of King Saladin_).

Two other texts have been rather tentatively attributed to Henry: 

 - His his translation of _Roman de la Rose_. Most scholars agree on Henry being the author of this text, since the scribe mentions a certain 'Henry of Brussels', being the original translator of the text.
 
 - An abridged version of the story of the story of _Cassamus_ has also been attributed to Henry, based on the fact that it immediately follows the abovementioned _Rose_-text in the manuscript.

 - Finally, the _Roman van Limborch_, an adventurous chivalric epic has also been attributed to him. However, the evidence for this attribution is very thin: one verse line mentions a certain "Heinriic" [...] "whom made this text".
